Team and Project Highlights
-------------------

Recruitment & Retention
: Responsible for designing and implementing the recruitment strategy for engineers in our Dublin team, with a focus on improving the inclusivity of our interview process, and diversifying our candidate sources. Working directly with internal recruitment & sourcing team, and our interviewing engineers, I am the key decision maker for all engineering hires in the office.

Production Operations
: Directed the operations team running the global production installations of Pivotal Tracker, a leading agile project management tool with 100k+ daily users. With a data driven approach using Site Reliability Engineering techniques, and a solid technology base of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, we operate a 24/7 on-call policy with only a handful of call outs each year.

Kubernetes system
: Directed 3 engineering teams on Pivotal's first Kubernetes product, Pivotal Container Service (PKS), balancing team and people health with product success and senior stakeholder management. Worked closely with product leadership to scale customer base up to 100+ significant enterprise customers as part of our initial product exploration phase. Designed and executed handover plan to a US based team over 6 months with emphasis on sustainable working conditions, continued product success, and enabling new teams for maximum success. 

Workshop Facilitation
: Delivered workshops on many data science and product related topics including: data discovery and exploration workshops for product teams & data scientists, idea generation and prioritisation workshops for CxOs & LOB leaders, agile development & Lean product workshops for product teams and as part of university courses, conference tutorial track on using Cloud Foundry with the Python PyData stack for practicing data scientists.


Top 10 Car Maker
: Developed a new data driven supply chain ordering process for a global top 10 automobile manufacturer. 
This system is now in production across European markets and realising savings of millions of Euro per year. 
Led the 4 data scientists in our 10 person team through the 6 month project, which included guiding client data scientists in Java & Python, Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and coordination as part of a User Centred product team. 
*Python, Hadoop, Java, Cloud Foundry*

Global High Street Bank
: Designed a new personalised messaging experience for retail customers. 
The tailored communications app for retail users incorporated insights and predictions from individuals’ live transaction data. 
Driving the iOS application is a pipeline of data processing and transforming micro-services, including overdraft entry prediction, anomaly detection and simple thresholding. 
Led the data science efforts of our combined team of data engineers, software engineers, and product managers for 6 months.
