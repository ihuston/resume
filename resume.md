Project Highlights
-------------------

Top 10 Car Maker
: Developed a new data driven supply chain ordering process for a global top 10 automobile manufacturer. 
This system is now in production across European markets and realising savings of millions of Euro per year. 
I led the 4 strong data science group through the 6 month project, which included guiding client data scientists in Java & Python, Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and coordination as part of a User Centred product team. 
*Python, Hadoop, Java, Cloud Foundry*

Global High Street Bank
: Designed a new personalised messaging experience for retail customers. 
The tailored communications app for retail users incorporated insights and predictions from individuals’ live transaction data. 
Driving the iOS application is a pipeline of data processing and transforming micro-services, including overdraft entry prediction, anomaly detection and simple thresholding. 
I led the data science efforts of our combined team of data engineers, software engineers, and product managers for 6 months.
*Spring Cloud Data Flow (Java), Python, Cloud Foundry, AWS*

Gaming group
: Built data quality pipelines and entity resolution models to combine data sources from multiple online gaming & gambling brands into a single view of the group’s customers.
*PostgreSQL UDFs, R*

Leading Global Reinsurer
: Introduced new algorithmic techniques to reduce simulation time in a global reinsurer’s catastrophe modelling from weeks to minutes. 
Built a parallel computation system which enabled growth of simulation size from small national regions to continent sized data sets.
*R*

Premium Car Brand
: Analysed live car telemetry data to create a premium service appointment booking system for the UK dealer franchise of a leading European car manufacturer.
*Python, Jupyter notebooks, Java, Cloud Foundry*

Further projects include data visibility in Oil & Gas sector, IoT asset management, and airport crowd visualisation.


Facilitation
------------

I have delivered workshops on many data science and product related topics including:

- Data discovery and exploration workshops for product teams & data scientists,
- Idea generation and prioritisation workshops for CxOs & LOB leaders,
- Agile development & Lean product workshops for product teams and as part of university courses,
- Conference tutorial track on using Cloud Foundry with the Python PyData stack for practicing data scientists.
