<h2 id="project-highlights">Project Highlights</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Top 10 Car Maker</dt>
<dd>Developed a new data driven supply chain ordering process for a global top 10 automobile manufacturer. This system is now in production across European markets and realising savings of millions of Euro per year. I led the 4 strong data science group through the 6 month project, which included guiding client data scientists in Java &amp; Python, Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and coordination as part of a User Centred product team. <em>Python, Hadoop, Java, Cloud Foundry</em>
</dd>
<dt>Global High Street Bank</dt>
<dd>Designed a new personalised messaging experience for retail customers. The tailored communications app for retail users incorporated insights and predictions from individuals’ live transaction data. Driving the iOS application is a pipeline of data processing and transforming micro-services, including overdraft entry prediction, anomaly detection and simple thresholding. I led the data science efforts of our combined team of data engineers, software engineers, and product managers for 6 months. <em>Spring Cloud Data Flow (Java), Python, Cloud Foundry, AWS</em>
</dd>
<dt>Gaming group</dt>
<dd>Built data quality pipelines and entity resolution models to combine data sources from multiple online gaming &amp; gambling brands into a single view of the group’s customers. <em>PostgreSQL UDFs, R</em>
</dd>
<dt>Leading Global Reinsurer</dt>
<dd>Introduced new algorithmic techniques to reduce simulation time in a global reinsurer’s catastrophe modelling from weeks to minutes. Built a parallel computation system which enabled growth of simulation size from small national regions to continent sized data sets. <em>R</em>
</dd>
<dt>Premium Car Brand</dt>
<dd>Analysed live car telemetry data to create a premium service appointment booking system for the UK dealer franchise of a leading European car manufacturer. <em>Python, Jupyter notebooks, Java, Cloud Foundry</em>
</dd>
